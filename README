# HigherOrderOptimizationMethods

This project examines the implementation and convergence of several optimization algorithms. Included in the project are Gradient Descent, Heavy-Ball, Conjugate Gradient Descent, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent, FISTA, and Barzilai-Borwein. All step sizes are determined utilizing an inexact line search with backtracking or an exact line search via the golden-selection search. The methods are compared for multiple vector sizes (5, 10, & 50) and all optimization methods had their parameters tuned via a limited grid search.

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.6+
```

Recommended:
```
Some Linux Distribution
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Install the necessary Python packages

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

All experiments are currently split by vector size. Please note, they are subject to change as the repository is cleaned.

To perform a grid search for a vector size:
```
python3 size_n#_search.py
```

To run a set of experiments with tuned parameters for a vector size:

```
python3 size_n#_test.py
```

### TODO

* Extensive documentation overhaul (mostly comments on the methods, helpers mostly good)
* Consolidate the experiments into notebooks
* Improve directory structure
